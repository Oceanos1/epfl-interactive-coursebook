If you are a teacher at EPFL, you might be familiar with the challenge of understanding what other teachers are teaching your students and how it relates to the content in your course or which courses teach similar or related concepts. You might have browsed through the different study plans and course books and opened multiple tabs on your web browser in order to make sense of the highly interconnected system of knowledge that is being presented in a fragmented way.\n",

    "The courses themselves will be represented by the nodes of the graph and dependencies between courses as (directed) edges. Different node colors, shapes and sizes will be used to distinguish nodes. For instance, the number of registered students could determine the node size. We envision both an impressive visualization and a rich interactive tool with options for searching and filtering. The user should be able to filter by level, section, program, specialization, course name or code. This can come in handy in many instances, for example when students want to see only the courses of their own program. When filters are applied, nodes in the immediate neighbourhood that don't fulfill the filter condition are displayed in a neutral color. When hovering over or selecting a node, information is displayed about the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have already deployed a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) using [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/). Most of the UI is implemented with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), a Vue UI library. \n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the main/home view can be seen in [Figure 1](#fig1). The filter sidebar will be expandable to enable more space for the main content (especially important when viewing on mobile). The home view navigation is a tabbed interface for pseudo-navigation in the home view, enabling the user to switch between network and list views of the current filter parameters. The network and list views are synchronized and \"kept alive\" so that they are not loaded again when the user switches between them. When the user enters the page, no filters are applied by default and all courses are visible. The list view has a simple paging functionality and is provided as an alternative which we will not discuss in detail here."

The courses themselves are represented by the nodes and dependencies between courses as (directed) edges, where the source is a prerequisite for the target. The graph is implemented using [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force). A simulation is created using `d3.forceSimulation()` and it is restarted when filters are changed. The [concrete implementation](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-vizcachas/blob/master/src/d3/graph.js) can be viewed on GitHub.\n",
